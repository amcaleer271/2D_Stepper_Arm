Scara type plotter driven by two stepper motors

This repo contains the Solidworks files and Arduino C++ code for a Scara type robot manipulator driven by two NEMA 17 Stepper Motors. 

The project is currently unfinished.

The individual files are accessible, along with a .zip containing all files linked in an assembly file.
